# Data Fellowship 12 - Assignment 3
### Task
Hey, data rangers! We got a data project from the business team. They need us to analyze NYC Taxi Trip data. Based on the requirements they want to understand the below insight, (at least)
- Monthly total passengers
- Monthly transactions per payment type
- Monthly trip distance per rate code

Based on organization architecture, you have to transform data using dbt. The raw data should be under `raw.nyc_taxi_trip` table. Generate multiple models based on needs. Based on governance, 60% of columns must have tests on each model in the dbt project. The description of the table and columns is mandatory.

Note:
- Custom at least 1 macros
- Custom at least 1 test
